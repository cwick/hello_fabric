This project demonstrates how to use Fabric to deploy a typical Django web application running on nginx and Gunicorn.

Features include:
    * Isolated deployment environments. Each deploy builds a Python virtualenv from scratch, installing the dependencies listed in requirements.txt. Dependencies are cached so subsequent deploys don't have to download anything.
    * Allows multiple versions to be kept on the server, and allows rollback to a previously-deployed version.
    * Old versions are automatically purged from the server (configurable).
    * Config files for server processes such as nginx are stored as templates. When deployed, templates are automatically filled with appropriate values.
    * 

Rollback:
    The server keeps an archive of the last 'MAX_DEPLOYED_VERSIONS' deploys. Through manipulation of
    symlinks, the server can change which one is currently the 'live' version. Use these
    commands to switch between versions.
    
    Rollback to the previously-deployed version. Good for those oh-shit-I-just-broke-the-site moments:
        fab rollback
    Additional invocations of 'rollback' will go back one more version, until you are at the oldest version.

    Rollback to the latest version:
        fab rollback:current
    Rollback to the specified version:
        fab rollback:<version number>
        
TODO:
    - Make an archive from version control instead of using rsync
